  <p> as someone who has used an ipad for five years and has also had many android devices for those same five years,<br>
   I can say that Androids indeed perform better the apple products. As a company android has been amazing with all <br>their
   advertisments and product quality. In 2014, Google launched an advertisment campaign titled "Be together. Not the same." <br>

<hr>
this campaign not only could be thought of as a clever marketing stratagy ;in a similar way to the dove self esteem project;but also a way to tell people androids come in all<br> different sizes.<br>
<hr>
  Not only has android taken steps to advance the variety of technology they offer, they are generally cheaper, more reliable, more easily customizable and well suited to <br>
  anyone who wants to pick one up. as one website says "like a father in a 1950s sitcom, apple thinks it knows best for you, no matter what you need or want, so it locks the<br>
  UI and offers fewer customizations then Google does."
